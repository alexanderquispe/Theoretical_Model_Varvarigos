Construct a PSID extract similar to the one used by Angrist (1991). PSID data are available
from the ISR:

\href{https://simba.isr.umich.edu/Zips/ZipMain.aspx}{https://simba.isr.umich.edu/Zips/ZipMain.aspx}

(use the cross-year index to select variables from family files).
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Calculate the grouped-data, Analysis of Covariance (fixed-effects), and OLS estimates of MaCurdy's (1981) specification reported by Angrist (1991, Table 3).
    \item
     How does Angrist (1991) explain differences in results across methods?
    \item
    Why does Card (1994) take a skeptical view of the large positive intertemporal substitution
elasticities generated by the grouped-data estimator in PSID data? Does evidence on the
labor supply responses of bicycle messengers and cab drivers address Card's concerns?
    \item
    Re-estimate the Angrist (1991) grouped-data specications using more recent data. Try to
    find a parsimonious trend specification that passes the relevant goodness-of-fit (overid) test.
    As far as the more recent ISE goes, what might you expect and why? How do the results
    come out?
    
    
\end{enumerate}
